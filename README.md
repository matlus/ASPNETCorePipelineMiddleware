# ASPNETCorePipelineMiddleware
In this episode, we'll take a look at the ASP.NET Core Pipeline Middle-ware. What is it, How it works, How to build custom middle-ware and why one would use these.

In this episode, we're modifying the project we did earlier (Responsibilities of a Controller) where we used ActionResults in order to Handle Exceptions.
